# __Long-read sequencing of trios reveals increased germline and postzygotic mutation rates in repetitive DNA__

This repository contains six Snakemake pipelines to call, phase, and validate de novo variants and to calculate callable genome size on the T2T-CHM13 v2.0 reference. Pipelines cover autosomes and sex chromosomes and are intended for use with multi-platform sequencing (HiFi, ONT, Illumina).

For full methodological details, see our arXiv submission: [link to arXiv manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.18.665621v1).

Notes:
- Each pipeline has its own `config.json` specifying reference paths and manifests. Update these paths for your environment.
- Example manifests are provided under `manifests/`.

## Pipelines
Pipeline-specific expected outputs and typical runtimes (assuming resources encoded in each `Snakefile`):

- **callable_genome/**
  - Expected output: BED files of accessible regions and per-sample callable genome size TSVs under `results/`.
  - Typical runtime: 2–3 weeks.

- **snv_calling/**
  - Expected output: validated de novo SNVs under `results/` (for example, `results/{family}_{sample}.snv_calls.tsv`).
  - Typical runtime: 4–8 hours.

- **indel_calling/**
  - Expected output: validated de novo indels under `validated_calls/`.
  - Typical runtime: 4–8 hours.

- **phasing/**
  - Expected output: per-sample haplotype assignments and origin (postzygotic/germline) integration under `results/`.
  - Typical runtime: 2–4 hours.

- **mnm_validation/**
  - Expected output: validated de novo multinucleotide mutations under `validated_mnms/`.
  - Typical runtime: 1–2 days.

- **sex_chromosomes/**
  - Expected output: validated sex-chromosome DNMs for males and females (SNVs and indels) under each subpipeline’s outputs.
  - Typical runtime: 2–4 hours.

Notes and tips:
- Some pipelines consume outputs of others. For example, `phasing/` expects SNV results from `snv_calling/` (see `phasing/Snakefile`), and `indel_calling/` expects prior indel candidates generated by `snv_calling/`; ensure upstream outputs exist or paths are adjusted accordingly.

## System requirements

- **Operating system**: Pipelines were written and tested on Ubuntu 22.04. Other operating systems have not been tested.
- **Required software**:
  - **Miniconda v4.12.0** (to enable per-rule conda environments).
  - **Snakemake 4.12.0** (other versions have not been tested with these workflows).
  - The pipelines declare software dependencies in their `envs/env.yaml` files and will create/activate those environments automatically when run with `--use-conda`.
- **Hardware**: No non-standard hardware is required. Jobs can be run locally or on a cluster. Example commands below include an SGE/DRMAA submission alias; cluster use is optional.

## Installation

The steps below install Miniconda and Snakemake on Ubuntu 22.04 using the Bioconda channels.

```bash
# Install Miniconda 4.12.0 (Linux x86_64)
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_4.12.0-Linux-x86_64.sh -O miniconda.sh
bash miniconda.sh -b -p "$HOME/miniconda3"
eval "$($HOME/miniconda3/bin/conda shell.bash hook)"
conda init bash  # or 'zsh' if you use zsh

# Configure Bioconda channels
conda config --add channels defaults    
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge

# Create an environment with Snakemake 4.12.0
conda create -y -n snakemake-4.12.0 snakemake=4.12.0
conda activate snakemake-4.12.0

# Optional (only if submitting via DRMAA to an SGE grid):
# conda install -y python-drmaa
```

- **Environment provisioning**: When you run any pipeline with `--use-conda`, Snakemake will automatically create and manage per-rule environments from the `envs/env.yaml` files.
- **Typical install time**: ~10–20 minutes on a standard desktop with broadband internet.

## Demo Instructions

All commands below are executed from a pipeline directory (for example, `snv_calling/` or `callable_genome/`). Before running, edit that pipeline’s `config.json` to point to your reference, manifests, and other inputs. Example manifests are in `manifests/`.

You can run locally or submit to an SGE cluster. To submit via DRMAA on SGE, define this alias (from the repo root or any pipeline directory):

```bash
alias snakesub='mkdir -p log; snakemake --ri --jobname "{rulename}.{jobid}" --drmaa " -V -cwd -j y -o ./log -e ./log -l h_rt={resources.hrs}:00:00 -l mfree={resources.mem}G -pe serial {threads} -w n -S /bin/bash" -w 60'
```

Then submit with:

```bash
snakesub -j [number of jobs] --use-conda
```

- Cluster integration beyond SGE/DRMAA is not provided here. If running on a different scheduler, adapt the submission command accordingly.

## Reproduction Instructions

- The original data used for analysis are available in the SFARI Base under accession **SFARI_DS714840** and in the NIH NDA **Collection ID 3780**. Access may require data use agreements through those portals.
- Update each pipeline’s `config.json` to point to your local copies of the reference (`T2T-CHM13v2.fasta`), manifests (for example, `manifests/bam_manifest.tab`, `manifests/vcf_manifest.tab`, `manifests/hifi_sources.tsv`), and any other required inputs (for example, TRF/RepeatMasker BEDs).
